# College Management System in C

This is a College Management System implemented in C. It allows for the management of courses and student registrations. Below, you'll find instructions on how to use the system and additional information.

## Usage
Once the program is running, you can interact with it using the command line interface. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various operations such as adding courses, registering students, deleting students from courses, and printing course information.

## Functionality
This College Management System offers the following functionality:

- **Acceptance of a New Course:** You can add new courses to the system by providing course numbers and names. The system validates the input.
- **Registration of Students for Courses:** Students can register for courses and include their grades. Ensure each student's information is unique.
- **Deletion of Students from Courses:** You can remove students from courses if needed.
- **Printing of Course Information:** The system allows you to print course information, including participants and their grades.
- **Printing All Courses and Calculations:** You can print a list of all courses in the system and perform calculations such as grade averages, maximum grades, and more.


## Data Structures Implemented
In this College Management System, I have implemented a custom linked list data structure to efficiently manage and store course and student information. The linked list is used for:

- Maintaining the list of courses.
- Managing the list of registered students for each course.
The linked list implementation ensures that data is organized, easily searchable, and efficient for various operations such as adding, updating, and deleting records.
